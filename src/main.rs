/* A small program that calulates the Standard Deviation
 * for a set of numbers.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A PERSONAL CHALLENGE PROJECT IT IS NOT COMPLETE.

    
    watching a @Primeagen video, the sir stated "go learn the standard
    deviation.." it was a video about software engineering *thinking* cant remember
    at that point, fixated on the word "Standard Deviation" stopped watching 
    @Primeagen and got inspired to just "Not search for a function." but "To search 
    for its formula and build a function based on instructions." 

    NOTE: easier said than done..

    instructions obtained watching 2 very informative youtubers on YouTube
    @SirBernieReyes and @TheOrganicChemistryTutor their breakdown, explaination 
    on Variance and Standard Deviation and solving a problem using the formula.
    
                           ____________
    Formula Population: 𝝈=√ ∑(xi-𝜇)^2
                            ----------
                                N
                
    In the formula above...
    𝝈 - is the standard deviation
    xi - is each individual data point in a set,
    𝜇 - is the mean.
    ^2 is the result of (xi - 𝜇) squared
    N - is the total number of data points.
    ∑ - is sum of the squared result.
